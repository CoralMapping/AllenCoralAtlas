## Background

The Allen Coral Atlas brings together partners from Planet, University of Queensland, Arizona State University's Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science (GDCS) and National Geographic Society to take high resolution satellite imagery and advanced analytics to map and monitor the world’s coral reefs in unprecedented detail. The Atlas aims to provide high-resolution, up-to-date global image of the world’s coral reefs, and detailed maps showing the composition and structure of five important reefs located throughout the world.
